# Basic Command Line App
###### Assigned: 8/4/18

#### Mechanics:
This is a command line app homework that was assigned during bootcamp. This was the first introduction to server side coding in the class, as a preparation for learning NodeJS. It's got pretty basic functionality, but pulls data in from various APIs and takes in command line inputs in response to questions.

**Known Issues:** None

**Potential Improvements:** Obviously, if you were to move forward with this project it would need a front end
